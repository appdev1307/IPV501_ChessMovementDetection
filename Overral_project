To extend the previous implementation to automatically detect both the chessboard and individual pieces, we need to add piece detection logic. This involves identifying whether a square contains a piece and, optionally, determining the piece type (e.g., pawn, knight) and color (white or black). The approach will use color-based thresholding and contour analysis to detect pieces, leveraging the contrast between pieces and the board. The code will still support both webcam feeds and video clips, detect the chessboard, divide it into squares, detect piece movements, and now identify pieces in each square.

### Approach
1. **Chessboard Detection**: Use OpenCV’s `findChessboardCorners` to locate the board and apply a perspective transform to obtain a top-down view.
2. **Square Division**: Divide the warped board into an 8x8 grid of squares.
3. **Piece Detection**: Analyze each square for the presence of a piece using color thresholding and contour detection to distinguish pieces from the background.
4. **Piece Identification**: Use basic heuristics (e.g., size, shape, color) to classify pieces by type and color, if possible.
5. **Move Detection**: Compare consecutive frames to detect changes in squares and output moves in chess notation.
6. **Input Flexibility**: Support both webcam feeds and video clips via command-line arguments.

### Assumptions
- The camera provides a clear, top-down view of a standard 8x8 chessboard.
- Pieces have sufficient color contrast with the board (e.g., white/black pieces on light/dark squares).
- Lighting is consistent to minimize false positives.
- Piece detection is based on simple heuristics (advanced piece classification would require machine learning, which we’ll simplify here).


### Key Additions and Changes
1. **Piece Detection (`detect_piece`)**:
   - **Color Analysis**: Uses the HSV color space to detect white or black pieces based on predefined color ranges. The ranges (`white_lower`, `white_upper`, `black_lower`, `black_upper`) are tuned for typical white/black pieces but may need adjustment.
   - **Contour Detection**: Finds contours in the color masks to identify pieces. A minimum contour area (`min_area = 100`) filters out noise.
   - **Piece Classification**: Currently labels pieces as "white" or "black" with type "unknown." Simple heuristics (e.g., contour size/shape) could be added for piece type, but advanced classification would require a trained model.
   - **Coordinate Mapping**: Maps warped square coordinates back to the original image to analyze the color content, ensuring accurate piece detection.

2. **Board State Tracking**:
   - Maintains a `board_state` list to store piece information for each of the 64 squares.
   - Updates the board state per frame and prints the current state for debugging.

3. **Move Reporting**:
   - When a move is detected, includes the piece’s color and type (if known) in the output, e.g., "white unknown from e2 to e4."

4. **Video Source**:
   - Retains support for both webcam (`--video ""`) and video clips (`--video path/to/video.mp4`).

3. **Run with Video Clip**:
   ```bash
   python chess_move_detector.py --video path/to/video.mp4
   ```
   - Replace `path/to/video.mp4` with your video file path.
   - The video should show a standard 8x8 chessboard with clear piece movements.

4. **Operation**:
   - Detects the chessboard and divides it into squares.
   - Identifies pieces in each square (white/black, type currently "unknown").
   - Detects moves by comparing frames and outputs in chess notation with piece info.
   - Displays the video with chessboard corners overlaid.
   - Prints the board state (piece in each square) for each frame.
   - Press 'q' to exit.

### Notes and Limitations
- **Piece Detection**:
  - Relies on color contrast in HSV space. Adjust `white_lower`, `white_upper`, `black_lower`, and `black_upper` based on your pieces and lighting.
  - Piece type detection is minimal ("unknown"). For accurate piece identification (e.g., pawn vs. knight), consider training a machine learning model (e.g., CNN) on piece images.
- **Thresholds**:
  - Change detection threshold (20 in `detect_change`) and contour area threshold (100 in `detect_piece`) may need tuning.
- **Lighting and Camera**:
  - Assumes consistent lighting and a top-down view.
  - Video clips should have clear, stable footage of the chessboard.
- **Performance**:
  - Real-time performance depends on hardware. Resize frames or optimize corner detection for better speed.
- **Extensibility**:
  - Add piece type detection using shape analysis or a pre-trained model.
  - Log moves to a file or generate a PGN (Portable Game Notation) file.
  - Handle castling or en passant with additional logic.

### Example Output
```
Square a8: black unknown
Square b7: white unknown
...
Move detected: white unknown from e2 to e4
```
